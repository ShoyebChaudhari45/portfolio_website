## 🚀 What is this

This portfolio is more than a static resume site. It is a crafted, interactive web presence that:

- Introduces who I am, my professional summary, and core skills.  
- Showcases my projects, experience, achievements, certifications & contact info.  
- Includes a floating AI-powered chat assistant (“Shoyeb AI”) — ask coding, projects, or career questions in real time.  
- Provides a **full-screen PDF Resume Viewer** — view, scroll, download or copy link.  
- Has a clean, responsive design with modern UI/UX and dark-themed, mobile-friendly layout.  

Purpose: give recruiters / clients / collaborators a polished, easy-to-navigate online profile that feels professional and interactive.
